# Applications in the Cloud

App Engine is a Platform-as-a-Service ("PaaS") offering. The App Engine platform manages the hardware and networking infrastructure required to run your code. App Engine provides built-in services that many web applications need. This module describes how App Engine works.

### Key Concepts

* Explain the purpose of and use cases for Google App Engine and Google Cloud Datastore
* Compare the App Engine Standard environment with the App Engine Flexible environment
* Express the purpose of and use cases for Google Cloud Endpoints
* Express the purpose of and use cases for Apigee Edge.
* Preview an App Engine application using Cloud Shell.
* Launch an App Engine application and then disable it.

## Module Introduction

> [![](https://img.youtube.com/vi//0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/)

* Recall that a PaaS is a platform as a service. 
    * The App Engine platform manages the hardware and networking infrastructure required to run your code. 
    * To deploy an application on App Engine, you just hand App Engine your code and the App Engine service takes care of the rest.
* App Engine is a PaaS for building scalable applications
    * App Engine makes deployment maintenance, and scalability easy so you focus on innovation
    * App Engine provides you with a built-in services that many web applications need. 
    * Especially suited for building scalable web applications and mobile backends
* App engine will scale your application automatically in response to the amount of traffic it receives.

### Practice Quiz: App Engine

1. (T/F) App Engine is a better choice for a web application than for long-running batch processing.
    > Answer: True.
    > Explanation: That's correct! App Engine will scale your application automatically in response to the amount of traffic it receives. Thatâ€™s why App Engine is especially suited for applications where the workload is highly variable, like a web application.
2. App Engine just runs applications; it doesn't offer any services to the applications it runs.
    > Answer: False.
    > Explanation: That's correct! App Engine offers NoSQL databases, in-memory caching, load balancing, health checks, logging, and user authentication to applications running in it.

## App Engine Standard Environment

> [![](https://img.youtube.com/vi//0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/)

* App Engine standard environment
    * Easily deploy your applications
    * Autoscale workloads
    * Free daily quota
    * Usage based pricing
        * What's distinctive about the Standard Environment though, is that low utilization applications might be able to run at no charge. 
    * SDKs for development, testing and deployment
* App Engine standard environment: Requirements
    * Specific versions of Java, Python, PHP and Go are supported
    * The Standard Environment also enforces restrictions on your code by making it run in a so-called "Sandbox." 
        * No writing to local files
        * All requests time out at 60s
        * Limits on third-party software
* Example App Engine standard workflow: Web applications
    1. Develop & test the web application locally
    2. Use the SDK to deploy to App Engine
    3. App Engine automatically scales & reliably serves your web application
    4. App Engine can access a variety of services using dedicated APIs

## App Engine Flexible Environment

> [![](https://img.youtube.com/vi//0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/)

* App Engine flexible environment
    * Build and deploy containerized apps with a click
    * No sandbox constraints
    * Can access App Engine resources
* Comparing the App Engine environments
    | | Standard Environment | Flexible Environment |
    |---|---|---|
    | Instance startup | Milliseconds | Minutes |
    | SSh access | No | Yes (although not by default) |
    | Write to local disk | No | Yes (but writes are ephemeral) |
    | Support for 3rd-party binaries | No | Yes |
    | Network access | Via App Engine services | Yes |
    | Pricing model | After free daily use, par per instance class, with automatic shutdown | Pay for resource allocation per hour, no automatic shutdown |
* Deploy Apps: Kubernetes Engine vs. App Engine
    | | Kubernetes Engine | App Engine Flexible | App Engine Standard |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | Language support | Any | Any | Java, Python, Go, PHP |
    | Service model | Hybrid | PaaS | PaaS |
    | Primary use case | Container-based workloads | Web and mobile applications, container-based workloads | Web and mobile applications |
    | | To managed infrastructure | | Toward dynamic infrastructure |

### Practice Quiz: App Engine Flexible and Standard Environment

1. Which of these criteria would make you choose App Engine Flexible Environment, rather than Standard Environment, for your application? Choose all that are correct (2 correct responses).
    * a. Finer-grained scaling
    * b. Daily free usage quota
    * c. Ability to ssh in
    * d. Wider range of choices for application language
    > Answer: c. d.
    > Explanation: At the time of this writing, App Engine Standard Environment supports Java, Python, PHP, and Go, but in the Flexible Environment, you upload your own runtime to run code in a language of your choice. App Engine Flexible Environment lets you ssh into the virtual machines in which your application runs.
2. (T/F) App Engine Flexible Environment applications let their owners control the geographic region where they run.
    > Answer: True.
    > Explanation: That's correct! You get to choose which region your applications run in.
