## Exampe Solution

1. What are some of the benefits to doing so?
    * It will help sales people sell more products, for example: If iPhone is a popular phone and customers like that phone. The sales people will not only sell the iPhone but products related to it like cases, chargers & etc but if we dont have the iPhone in stock it is highly unlikely that a customer would want some other phone and the sales person doesnt only lose that sale but the potential of upselling products related to iPhone but if there was a way to predict how many iPhone we sell & schedule an inventory shipment ahead of time the business wouldnt run into the problem of losing the sales.
2. What kinds of data would you collect if you wanted to do this?
    * Sales numbers from X amount of years, Inventory from x amount of years to compare when we need more phones and when we dont really need that many phones instock. Returns from x amount of years, how often the store receives shipment
3. Are you collecting that data today? If no, why not?
    * No
    * There is no system to collect that data everything is manual
