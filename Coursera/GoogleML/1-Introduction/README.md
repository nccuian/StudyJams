* Two aspects of moving on to doing ML with TensorFlow
    * Creating a good Machine Learning dataset
    * Building your first Machine Learning model with TensorFlow
* Machine learning on Google Cloud Platform
    1. How Google does ML
        * Why ML?
    2. ML with TensorFlow
        * Creating ML datasets
        * Introduction to TensorFlow
    3. Improving ML Accuracy
        * Feature engineering
        * The art and science of ML
    4. ML at Scale
        * Production ML systems
        * End-to-end lab on structured ML data
    5. Specialized ML Models
        * Image classification models
        * Sequence models
        * Recommendation systems
* Portion of this specialization are from other Google courses; but the detail are different
    * ML with TensorFlow
        * Serverless Machine Learning with TensorFlow
        * Taught by Google Cloud, on Coursera
    * Improving ML Accuracy
        * Machine Learning Crash Course
        * Taught by Google, at some universities
    * You may have encountered some of this material before
        * I.e., Creating Machine Learning datasets and on TensorFlow basics
        * Some of the slides will be a repeat of serverless Machine Learning with TensorFlow, that's available on Coursera.

* At Google, we apply machine learning in nearly all our products
    * Targeted ads to display in *Adwards*
    * Recommedations for the next video in *YouTube*
    * Pedestrain detection *Self-driving Cars*
    * Spam detection in *Gmail*
* There are over 4000 TensorFlow machine learning models in production at Google, and it has transformed our company

* To be successful at ML, you need to think, not just about *creating models*, but also about **serving out ML predictons**
* To be good at ML, you need to be good at data engineering
    1. Scalability Reliabilty Engineering
    2. Data Collection
    3. Data Analytics
    4. Data Pipelines
    5. Machine Learning
