# How Google does Machine Learning

> Course 1 of 5 in the [Machine Learning with TensorFlow on Google Cloud Platform Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-tensorflow-gcp)

What is machine learning, and what kinds of problems can it solve? Google thinks about machine learning slightly differently -- of being about logic, rather than just data. We talk about why such a framing is useful for data scientists when thinking about building a pipeline of machine learning models. 

Then, we discuss the five phases of converting a candidate use case to be driven by machine learning, and consider why it is important the phases not be skipped. We end with a recognition of the biases that machine learning can amplify and how to recognize this.
