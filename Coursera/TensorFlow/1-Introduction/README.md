# Introduction

The tool we will use to write machine learning programs is TensorFlow and so in this course, we will introduce you to TensorFlow. In the first course, you learned how to formulate business problems as machine learning problems and in the second course, you learned how machine works in practice and how to create datasets that you can use for machine learning. Now that you have the data in place, you are ready to get started writing machine learning programs.
