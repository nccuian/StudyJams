# Introduction to TensorFlow

> Course 3 of 5 in the [Machine Learning with TensorFlow on Google Cloud Platform Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-tensorflow-gcp)

We introduce low-level TensorFlow and work our way through the necessary concepts and APIs so as to be able to write distributed machine learning models. Given a TensorFlow model, we explain how to scale out the training of that model and offer high-performance predictions using Cloud Machine Learning Engine.

## Course Objectives

* Create machine learning models in TensorFlow
* Use the TensorFlow libraries to solve numerical problems
* Troubleshoot and debug common TensorFlow code pitfalls
* Use tf.estimator to create, train, and evaluate an ML model
* Train, deploy, and productionalize ML models at scale with Cloud ML Engine
