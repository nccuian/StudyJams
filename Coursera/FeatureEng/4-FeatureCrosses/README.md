# Introducing 

In traditional machine learning, feature crosses donâ€™t play much of a role, but in modern day ML methods, feature crosses are an invaluable part of your toolkit.In this module, you will learn how to recognize the kinds of problems where feature crosses are a powerful way to help machines learn.

* The feature cross provides a way to combine features in a linear model
    * Using non-linear inputs in a linear learner

* A feature cross memorize the input space
* Goal of ML is generalization
* Memorization works when you have lots of data
* Feature crosses are powerful

* Which of these cars is a taxi?
    * Assume that your input data looks like this
        * e.g., Red, Rome; White, Rome; Yellow, NYC; White, NYC; ...
    * The linear model has problems; the feature cross has no problem
* Feature crosses bring a lot of power to linear model
    * Feature crosses + massive data is an efficient way of learning highly complex spaces
    * Feature crosses allow a linear model to memorize large datasets
    * Optimizing linear models is a convex problem
    * Before TensorFlow, Google used massive scale learners

* Feature crosses combine discrete / categorical features
    * E.g., Cross `hour_of_day` with `day_of_week` to predict traffic
        * How many inputs would we have if we simply one-hot-encoded the hour of day and the day of week and provided it to a model?
            > Answer: 24 input nodes for hours in the day + 7 inputs for days of the week = 31
        * How many inputs do we now have for our model?
            > Answer: 24 x 7 inputs = 168 total inputs
