# Lab 5: Feature Crosses to Create a Good Classifier

## Overview

In this lab, you will use the Tensorflow playground to develop an intuitive understanding of feature crosses. Click on these links and try to add new features while continuing to use a linear model.

## TensorFlow Playground

1. For each of the above lab links, access the TensorFlow playground lab.
   * http://goo.gl/2NUCAF
       * Feature: $x_1x_2$
   * http://goo.gl/ivd4x4
       * Features: $x_1^2$, $x_2^2$
2. The questions to consider:
    * What's the best performance you can get?
    * Which feature crosses help the most?
    * Does the model output surface look like a linear model?
