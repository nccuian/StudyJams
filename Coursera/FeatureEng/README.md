# Feature Engineering

> Course 4 of 5 in the [Machine Learning with TensorFlow on Google Cloud Platform Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-tensorflow-gcp)

Want to know how you can improve the accuracy of your machine learning models? What about how to find which data columns make the most useful features? Welcome to Feature Engineering on Google Cloud Platform where we will discuss the elements of good vs bad features and how you can preprocess and transform them for optimal use in your machine learning models.

In this course, you will get hands-on practice choosing features and preprocessing them inside of Google Cloud Platform with interactive labs. Our instructors will walk you through the code solutions which will also be made public for your reference as you work on your own future data science projects.
