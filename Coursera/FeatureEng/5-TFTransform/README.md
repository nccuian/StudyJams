# TF Transform

TensorFlow Transform (`tf.Transform`) is a library for preprocessing data with TensorFlow. `tf.Transform` is useful for preprocessing that requires a full pass the data, such as: - normalizing an input value by mean and stdev - integerizing a vocabulary by looking at all input examples for values - bucketizing inputs based on the observed data distribution In this module we will explore use cases for `tf.Transform`.
