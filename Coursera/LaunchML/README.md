# Launching into Machine Learning

> Course 2 of 5 in the [Machine Learning with TensorFlow on Google Cloud Platform Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-tensorflow-gcp)

Starting from a history of machine learning, we discuss why neural networks today perform so well in a variety of data science problems. We then discuss how to set up a supervised learning problem and find a good solution using gradient descent. This involves creating datasets that permit generalization; we talk about methods of doing so in a repeatable way that supports experimentation.

## Course Objectives

* Identify why deep learning is currently popular
* Optimize and evaluate models using loss functions and performance metrics
* Mitigate common problems that arise in machine learning
* Create repeatable and scalable training, evaluation, and test datasets
