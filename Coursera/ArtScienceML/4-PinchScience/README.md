# A Pinch of Science

In this module, we will start to introduce the science along with the art of machine learning. We’re first going to talk about how to perform regularization for sparsity so that we can have simpler, more concise models. Then we’re going to talk about logistic regression and learning how to determine performance.

* Zeroing out coefficients can help with performance, especially with large models and sparse inputs
    | Actions | Impact |
    |---|---|
    | Fewer coefficients to store/load | Reduce memory, model size |
    | Fewer multiplications needed | Increase prediction speed |
    $$
    L(w, D) + \lambda \sum^{n}{|w|}
    $$
    * L2 regularization only makes weights **small**, not zero
