## Module Quiz

1. What is the key difference between supervised and unsupervised models?
    * A. Unsupervised learning requires even more labeled training data since the model is less controlled during training
    * B. Supervised models are better for prediction than unsupervised because the label is known
    * C. Unsupervised models need fewer data points for accurate modelling as compared to supervised learning
    * D. Supervised models learn to predict based on known labels whereas unsupervised models are more concerned with discovering patterns in the dataset
    > Answer: D.
2. (True or Fals)e A decision tree is always a good model to pick because it is to visually appealing to business users

3. Select the model you would try first if you had labeled, non-continuous value data?
    * A. Linear Regression
    * B. Classification
    * C. Neither
    * D. Either one
    > Answer: B.
