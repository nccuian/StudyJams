* What is Machine Learning (ML)?
    * Machine learning (ML) is the process of a computer writing a computer program to accomplish a task
    * vs. Software Engineers write program rules
    * Machine Learning figures out program rules
        * Lots of inputs $\leftarrow$ Lots of outputs
* The ML Suprise
    * Defining KPI's (Key Performance Indicator)
    * Collecting data
    * Building infratructure
    * Optimizing ML algorithm
    * Integration

## Secret Sauce

* "Get your hands dirty by practicing with technical skills"
* Avoid these top 10 ML pitfalls
    1. ML requires just as much softwae infrastructure
    2. **No data collected yet**
    3. Assume the data is ready for use
    4. Keep humans in the loop
    5. Product launch focused on the ML algorithm
    6. ML optimizing for the wrong thing
    7. Is your ML improving things in the real world
    8. Using a pre-trained ML algorithm vs. building your own
    9. ML algorithms are trained more than once
    10. Trying to design your own perception or NLP algorithm
* Most ML value comes along the way
* ML improves almost everything it touches
* If ML is hard, it's hard for your competitors too
* ML is a great differentiator

* How change happens in phases
    1. Individual contributor
        * E.g., Google Reception in San Francisco CA
    2. Delegation
        * E.g., Store Checker
    3. Digitization
        * E.g., ATM
    4. Big Data and Analytics
        * E.g., Efficient Car Manufacturing
    5. Machine Learning
        * E.g., YouTube Recommendation Engine

## Path to Machine Learning

> [![](https://img.youtube.com/vi/ZzVPYqudsRQ/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/ZzVPYqudsRQ)

* The path to ML
    1. Individual contributor
        * Prototype and try out ideas
        * Danger of skipping this step:
            * Inability to scale
            * Product heads make big, incorrect assumptions that are hard to change later
        * Danger of lingering too long here:
            * One person gets sklled and then leaves
            * Fail to scale up the process to meet demand in time
    2. Delegation
        * Gently ramp up to include more people
        * Danger of skipping this step:
            * Not forced to formalize the process
            * Inherent diversity in uman responses become a testbed -- great product learning opportunity
            * Great ML systems will need humans in the loop
        * Danger of lingering too long here:
            * Paying a high marginal cost to serve each user
            * More voices will say automation isn't possible
            * Organizational lock-in
    3. Digitization
        * Automate mundane parts of the process
        * Danger of skipping this step:
            * You will always need infrastructure
            * IT project and ML success tied and the whole project will fail if either does need humans in the loop
        * Danger of lingering too long here:
            * Your competitors are collecting data and tuning their offers from these new insights
    4. Big Data and Analytics
        * Measure and achieve data-driven success
        * Danger of skipping this step:
            * Unclean data means no ML training
            * You can't measure success
        * Danger of lingering too long here:
            * Limit the complexity of problems you can solve
    5. Machine Learning
        * Automated feedback loop that can outspace human scale
